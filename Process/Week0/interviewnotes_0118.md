* Bill Salvatore - Dir of Strategic Development, PPR (training, recruitment, partnership work, etc)
* Team lead for goal #3 of strategic plan, better aligning staffing structure
* Andy â€“ lead evaluation on the recreation side of parks and rec, 700 employees, works on the programming side

* Since hearing about Safegraph in 2020, excited about promise of what that type of data offers in terms of making decisions, being more effective and more efficient, "fills a gap..don't know about use of facilities that aren't tracked on work order, permit, program..."

* Data: Places, programs, safegraph activity, what are the markets are for programming/facilities?

* What do you need to know to take mobile programming resources?
  - 150-160 recreation centers that avenue buildings, staff the building based on size of the building, don't take into consideration neighborhood, crime, etc.
  - looked at sites and their amenitities, look at neighboring parks, crime factors
  - identified a priority score, 
  - 1 mile around rec center is "community area"...how can we staff the whole neighborhood? 
  - created program crew that are support staaff that can move around that area


What is the formula? 
How should Safegraph factor in?
Program data and Safegraph data 

Really interested in park space...only measure of this so far has been "amount of trash collected"

(look at Michael's nighttime businesses dashboard)

buckets of events: atheltic, cultural, educational, environmental
- what's being underserved?

COMMUNITY SERVICE AREAS
- are people traveling across service areas?
- not necessary to look outside service areas
- For 70 years, didn't look across the street..

- for goal 3: programming in new CSAs will be heavily-community-informed. If we're seeing church that's active, we should know about it.

Could the product we're building be used by the crews?

--

- # of people
- Timeslots (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Weekday vs weekend, season
- philly residents vs non-philly residents
- can we see if adults are parents? age? gender? are they parents?
- How can we disentangle adults from adults+childrens?
- No data from kids under 13.

1.Figure out what the market is for the park and how to dispatch resources

2.150 160 playgrpunds, based on size, did nit consider other factors like community, crime, 

a score for that, higher, staff

3.25 zones, still in the process. still lock in. Want it dynamic.

4.500-700 staffs



Short term.

Know the activity, how people use the services.



community service area 1mile-radius



A season ahead. Morning and afternoon



how many kinds of programming we have and can dispatch

80/90 7 types list

can we have the activity data



2021



There is no children under age 13 in the safegraph dataset.

But they are linked with census data, and so that we can obtain the demographic data.
