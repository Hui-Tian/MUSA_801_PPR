* Bill Salvatore - Dir of Strategic Development, PPR (training, recruitment, partnership work, etc)
* Team lead for goal #3 of strategic plan, better aligning staffing structure
* Andy â€“ lead evaluation on the recreation side of parks and rec, 700 employees, works on the programming side

* Since hearing about Safegraph in 2020, excited about promise of what thaat type of data offers in terms of making decisions, being more effective and more efficient, "fills a gap..don't know about use of facilities that aren't tracked on work order, permit, program..."

* Data: Places, programs, safegraph activity, what are the markets are for programming/facilities?

* What do you need to know to take mobile programming resources?
  - 150-160 rec centers thath ave buildings, staff the building based on size of the building, don't take into consideration neighborhood, crime, etc.
  - looked at sites and their amenitities, look at neighboring parks, crime factors
  - identified a priority score, 
  - 1 mile around rec center is "community area"...how can we staff the whole neighborhood? 
  - created program crew that are support staaff that can move around that area


What is the formula? 
How should Safegraph factor in?
Program data and Safegraph data 

Really interested in park space...only measure of this so far has been "amount of trash collected"

(look at Michael's nighttime businesses dashboard)

buckets of events: atheltic, cultural, educational, environmental
- what's being underserved?

COMMUNITY SERVICE AREAS
- are people traveling across service areas?
- not necessary to look outside service areas
- For 70 years, didn't look across the street..

- for goal 3: programming in new CSAs will be heavily-community-informed. If we're seeing church that's active, we should know about it.
